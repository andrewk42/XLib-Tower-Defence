README file for Andrew Klamut's SE382 Assignment 1:

Please ensure that you have the file 'bg_full.xbm' in the same directory of
my game before playing. It is crucial as it is my game's background image.
If you can find my submitted .zip, it is definitely included in there.

How to play:
    Kill the enemies with the correspondingly-coloured guns. Pretty simple.

Noteable features:
-Instead of using a double-buffer style repaint of the screen, I repaint parts
of my background image to avoid a lot of flickering. I feel like this is a
creative alternative to the typical solution though at the end I had to rush
through some parts (i.e. the rockets)
-A bottom toolbar, which makes for a better overall user experience
-Complex (relatively) gameplay using a variety of mouse events, which keeps
the user interested
-Fairly well-structured code
